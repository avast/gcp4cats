# GCP4Cats

Google provides a pretty decent set of libraries for working with GCP services. However, using them from (functional)
Scala requires a lot of repetition and boilerplate. It would be very useful to have a common library that does the
lifting of the Java API into Scala Universe. This is that library.

## Goals
### 1. Keep the API close to official JVM API.
This way we can leverage all the great documentation already provided for JVM API as well as ensure easy maintenance for the years to come
