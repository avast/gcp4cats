# GCP4Cats

Google provides a pretty decent set of libraries for working with GCP services. However, using them from (functional)
Scala requires a lot of repetition and boilerplate. It would be very useful to have a common library that does the
lifting of the Java API into Scala Universe. This is that library.

## Objectives
- Minimise breaking changes
- Keep the code as close to official java lib as possible
